    <h1>Greetings From Afar</h1>
    <p>Dear <?php echo $friend_name; ?>,</p>
    <p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in the mountains of Tibet while I learn programming! </p>
    <p><?php echo $friend_name; ?>, you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead. But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
    <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>Diane</p>
